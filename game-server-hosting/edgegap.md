# EdgeGap

In this simple guide, we'll go through how you get started hosting your dedicated server(s) with EdgeGap in PurrNet. Luckily, this is very easy!

First, start by getting setup and logged in to [EdgeGap](https://app.edgegap.com/) so you can access the dashboard. And after this, have a brief look at [their own documentation](https://docs.edgegap.com/), to get setup with their Unity editor tool.

### Installing EdgeGap in Unity

Go your your top toolbar: `Tools -> PurrNet -> Addon Library -> Install EdgeGap`. This will automatically import the tool into your project!
