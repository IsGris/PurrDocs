**Cast your rod in zero gravity and reel in the weirdest catches the galaxy has to offer‚Äîwelcome to GLORB, the ultimate space fishing adventure!**\
Solo or co-op, you‚Äôll fish for bizarre lifeforms called Glorbs (Gross Lumpy Organisms Roaming Blorptown), each with unique traits, behaviors, and delicious potential. Catch them, contain them, and cook them into galaxy-famous snacks like GLORB Hotdogs!

Every Glorb you fish up affects gameplay: what you can craft, how you expand, and what chaos ensues when you test your creations yourself.
