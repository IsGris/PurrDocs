Land of Symbiosis is a solo or co-op Action RPG that blends base defense, exploration, and sandbox survival in a procedurally generated alien world.

Battle through waves of thousands of mechanical creatures, scavenge their remains, and loot the environment to craft powerful weapons, armor, and automated defenses.

Fast-paced top-down combat and cooperative gameplay makes it a perfect survival experience to share with friends or brave alone,

To survive, you must navigate the hostile environments of planet Sigma Century gathering resources, crafting tools, and upgrading your equipment to fend off relentless creatures.

Drinking and eating are handled efficiently by your advanced suit technology.

However, generating oxygen is another story. You'll need to find, harvest, and process specific elements to keep your life support system running
