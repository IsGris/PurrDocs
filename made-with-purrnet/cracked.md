[Check it out on Steam!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3917010/CRACKED/)

**CRACKED** is a fast-paced, 3D PvP roguelike where glass-headed mages go head-to-head (or head-to-shards) in chaotic arena duels. Inspired by _Rounds_ and powered by physics-based combat, every fight is unpredictable, explosive, and wildly replayable.

Play solo or team up in 1v1, 2v1, or 2v2 showdowns. After every round, choose from a pool of powerful, quirky upgrades that stack into outrageous builds â€” from homing fireballs and knockback shockwaves to rapid-fire chaos or debilitating hexes.

No two fights are the same. No glass head survives forever.
