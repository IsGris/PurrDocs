# UniTask

PurrNet supports UniTask automatically if it is installed through the `Package Manager` otherwise you need to manually set the `UNITASK_PURRNET_SUPPORT` script symbol in your player settings.

We have a convenience button in the menus to install/uninstall `UniTask` using the `Package Manager`.

UniTask is just a better and more efficient way to work with asynchronous methods in Unity.
