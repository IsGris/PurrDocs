# PurrChat (AI assistant)

Netcode is the hardest part of game dev. PurrChat makes it simpler.

You’ve been there: stuck in the docs, posting in the discord, experimenting for hours just to figure out one detail. Or maybe you’re deep into PurrDiction, fighting jittery movement, rollback bugs, and trying to understand what belongs in state and what doesn’t.

What if instead you could just ask? Always available. Always grounded in the official docs and real source code. With PurrChat, those hours of guesswork become minutes of clear, source-backed answers.

👉 Built on the official PurrNet documentation and real PurrNet/PurrDiction source code.

## Ready-to-ask prompts

* “Explain server authority vs client authority in PurrNet. Which should I use for \[my mechanic], and why?”
* “Create a minimal client-side prediction controller for \[movement], with Simulate() logic and UpdateView() visuals.”
* “Owned player is smooth; non-owned players jitter. Show me the correct view/interpolation setup and where I likely went wrong.”
* “Observed players rollback when I use prediction. Audit my state vs view responsibilities and fix the rollback cause.”
* “What belongs in my predicted state for a melee combo system? What must stay out (and where do I put it)?”
* “How do I build a lobby with the Lobby System and then move players into a game scene?”
* “Why is my async RPC not returning on the client? Show the correct async RPC pattern with return values.”
