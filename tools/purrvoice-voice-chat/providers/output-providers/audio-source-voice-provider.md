# Audio Source Voice Provider

The Audio Source Voice Provider is the simplest implementation of the default Unity Audio Source playback there is. Simply add it to the output provider field, and feed it your audio source to playback from, and that's it! The rest of the audio logic will be moving as expected and played back from the Unity Audio Source.

This also means that you can modify and filter the Unity Audio Source as you'd like, and there shouldn't be any limitations in that regard.
