# Sync Types

All sync types (e.g., `SyncVar`, `SyncList`) are built on our network module system.\
Any limitations or features of `NetworkModule` apply to them as well.

This means you can create your own sync types or modulesâ€”`SyncVars` are just network modules, not magic. Anyone, including you, can build custom modules using the same system.
