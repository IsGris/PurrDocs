# Code stripping

Code stripping allows for server code to be automatically removed from client builds. This allows for an added layer of safety to your Server-Client games. And it's all handled for you by PurrNet.

It will automatically strip all server specific code from all builds but Server builds. You can find the setting in Project Settings -> Networking -> PurrNet -> Strip Server Code, and simply toggle the bool.
