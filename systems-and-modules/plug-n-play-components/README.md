# Plug n' play components

Plug n' play components allows you to simply add a component to your object, in order to automatically handle some networking for you. Normal examples of this is the [Network Transform](network-transform.md) allowing you to automatically network the position, rotation and scale of an object. Or the [Network Animator](network-animator.md) allowing you to automatically sync animations.
