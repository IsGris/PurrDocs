# NetworkBehaviour

Network Behaviour should be treated like your MonoBehaviour but for acting on the network. This also inherits from [Network Identity](./).

From your Network Behaviour scripts, you'll be able to call [RPC's](../remote-procedure-call-rpc/), handle [synchronization](../network-modules/sync-types/syncvar.md), transfer [ownership](ownership.md), and more.
