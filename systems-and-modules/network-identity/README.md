# Network Identity

The Network Identity is the core of most networking logic. This plays into the component based nature of object oriented programming with Unity. The [Network Behaviour](networkbehaviour.md) also inherits from Network Identity, meaning that nearly any script interacting on the network, is also a Network Identity.

You can inherit from Network Identity directly, but it is mostly recommended to have your script inherit from [Network Behaviour](networkbehaviour.md).

Network Identity components can have an owner, and the behavior and control given to said owner will depend on the settings within the [Network Rules](../network-manager/network-rules.md).&#x20;

A single gameobject can have as many Network Identities as you'd want, and [ownership ](ownership.md)doesn't necessarily act on a per gameobject level, but can also be handled on a **per component level**. So one gameobject can have multiple components with different owners. There is a setting on the network identity, to propagate this ownership to the entire object on which it resides. This is also a default setting on the [Network Rules](../network-manager/network-rules.md).
