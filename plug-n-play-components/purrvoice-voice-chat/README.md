{% hint style="warning" %}
PurrVoice is currently in [**Early Access**](../../terminology/early-access.md)**,** meaning that only paid support members in the Discord has access to it. This will become available for free in the future!
{% endhint %}

**PurrVoice** makes adding voice chat to your game effortless. Built for PurrNet, it’s a plug-and-play system that supports dynamic, fully networked audio filters—handled on the sender, server, or receiver side. Filters can be added or removed at runtime and will automatically sync across the network. Each filter can have a custom strength on the instance that applies it, without wasting bandwidth syncing values unnecessarily.

Whether you’re building casual co-op or competitive multiplayer, PurrVoice gives you a flexible, and powerful voice integration—out of the box.
