# ðŸ¥° Support PurrNet

Using PurrNet is 100% free, but supporting us by letting us support you, is the best way to go about it. We have a few different support tiers, as well as we can also do larger enterprise level support if that is more interesting to you.

In order to support us, and claim your Discord role and early access features, simply enter the [store page here](https://whop.com/purrnet/) and choose a tier that works for you.\

If you want a larger support experience, for example paid support or direct consulting, contact me (Bobsi) directly on [Discord (you can find us in our server)](https://discord.gg/HnNKdkq9ta)
