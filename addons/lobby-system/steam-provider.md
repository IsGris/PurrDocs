# Steam Provider

This provider is built by the PurrNet team, and is a simple yet effective implementation for Steamworks.net, allowing you to easily create and close lobbies, invite friends or join by code.

In order to work with the Steam provider, you need Steamworks.NET installed. If you don't have that already, don't worry! We got your back.

Simply hit the "Add Steamworks.NET to Package Manager" button which is found on the **Steam Lobby Provider** component. Wait a few seconds and the import will start. Once done, you're ready to go! Start up the Steam client on your computer and hit play in Unity. It's as easy as that.&#x20;
