## Adding it to your project

You can add PurrNet to your project in 3 ways:

### **Unity Asset store**

It's as easy as going to the asset store using this link, and adding it like a normal package: [https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/297320](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/297320)

### **Git (Package Manager)**

Through the package manager you can add a package using a git URL. Just add the following URL, and whenever you need PurrNet updated, you can update it directly from the package manager:

`https://github.com/PurrNet/PurrNet.git?path=/Assets/PurrNet#release`\
\
You can also use the `dev` branch if you're looking to access the latest features, though it may come at the cost of stability. You can switch at any time by using either URLs:&#x20;

`https://github.com/PurrNet/PurrNet.git?path=/Assets/PurrNet#dev`

### **GitHub (Package Import)**&#x20;

You can download the latest release from [this page](https://github.com/PurrNet/PurrNet/releases) and simply double click it to import it into your project

You can now continue on to the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) page
